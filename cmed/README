cmed is a simple graphical colormap editor.
It reads and writes files in a simple plain-text form
which is readable by partiview's "cmap" command.

You can drag and sweep with various mouse buttons to adjust color.
E.g. middle-mouse drag adjusts saturation.
"HSB" button toggles between hue/sat/brightness and
red/green/blue.  Dragging with shift-left-button adjusts
alpha (transparency), although partiview currently ignores alpha
in colormaps.

Dragging with some mouse-button over the color window
adjusts the corresponding color curve.
The "Force" slider determines how; with "Force" set to
maximum, the mouse position directly sets the value.
With lower "Force" settings, the color curve is
fractionally displaced toward the mouse position,
making finer adjustments easier.
Try sweeping back and forth for a "brushing" effect.

Clicking "Undo" undoes the last drag (i.e. everything
since the mouse was last depressed over the color window).
Especially handy if you drag with the wrong button pressed.
Another "Undo" reverts to the changed state (i.e. it toggles).

To save, type a new name in the text-box and hit "Save".
To (re)load an existing file, type its name and press "Load".

To resample a colormap to have a different number of
entries, type in text box something like
