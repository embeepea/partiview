Program:    partiview ('PC-VirDir')
Version:    2000-10-04


Most documentation should be in the doc tree.

To install, make sure you have installed ftlk and OpenGL (or MESA), then

	cd src
	configure
	make

and you should in principle be ready to run the program. A simple example
how to get going can also be found in the file AAA_SOURCE_ME. This file
can be sourced which will compile partiview and give some hints what to
do next.
